    title: Geographical Location
    description: >
      <p> Wuthaylan National Park is approximately 120km south of Riyadh city. It is located at XY coordinates 687288.89 and 2638812.89, respectively.  It is bordered by 4 governorates as follows (see tha map on the left): Al Hariq (Southwest), Howtat Bani Tamim (Southeast), Al Dilam (Northeast) and Al Muzahimiya (Northwest).</p>
      <p> The National Park was established on 7th May 2018 based on the Royal Decree No. 22435. The land of the National Park (approximately 58, 259ha) was demarcated in accordance with approval plans No. 11402 and 11714 of the earlier Al Kharj Governorate of Riyadh region. </p>
          It was established to:
      <li> Conserve the natural resources of Wuthaylan ecosystem  for the benefit of present and future generations.</li>
      <li> Promote nature-based and recreation tourism for the enjoyment of residents and international visitors.</li>
      <li> Promote scientific research on best practices in conservation and sustainable management of national parks.</li>

      <li><b> Topographical (Wadi Systems/channels & plateau escarpments) </b></li>
      <li><b> Biodiversity (Flora & Fauna)</b></li>
      <li><b> Ecotourism Value (Existing and Proposed services/products)</b></li>
      <p> The principal topographical features in Wuthaylan National Park landscape include the Wadi system habitats and the Tuwaiq mountain range escarpments.</p> 
      <p> Biodiversity at these sections is diverse but  relatively limited since they contain some of the most ecologically disturbed habitats. Therefore, more protection is needed to provide conducive environment for biodiversity to recolonize  the wider areas of the Wuthaylan National Park.</p>

    title: Wadi Systems/channels
    description: >
      <p> The wadi channels are dry dominated by sand and gravels except in rainy seasons in winter when sporadic rainfall sinks into the porous wadi beds to recharge and form sub flows and run offs.
      These wadis form a network of attractive  reasonably well  vegetated community of ground flora stands inhabiting the main wadi channels. This creates contrast to the hyper-aridity of the wider area of the Najd plateau in central Arabia. The principal water course in the National Park is Wadi Wuthaylan. It appears originates from several branches on Jabal Tuwaiq escarpments on the western side of Wuthaylan National Park within Al Muzahimiya governorate and drains in South Easterly direction towards the Park entrance on the side of Al Dilam governorate. The drainage basin of Wadi Wuthaylan valley cuts through the central portion of the Park running from west to east for approximately 70km.  It is joined by the valleys of Wadi Mawan from Northeast. The convergence of these wadis cumulatively with their numerous tributaries which drain off  into  Wadi As Sawat  that flows towards Al Dilam city. </p>

    title: Plateau escarpments
    description: >
      <p> Jabal Tuwaiq mountain ranges are narrow escarpments composed of sedimentary strata of the middle Jurassic limestone rocks. It runs from the southern borders of Al Qassim, intersects through the Najd plateau of central Arabia, to the northern edge of the Empty Quarter desert near wadi Ad-Dawasir. </p>
      <p> On the western side, Jabal Tuwaiq plateau ends abruptly in cliffs of several hundreds meters high on Qiddiya, Huraymila, Thadiq and Al-Ghat with a succession of laminated rocks rich in organic matter. </p>
      <p> Jabal Tuwaiq limestone escarpments are noticeably the main geological features within Wuthaylan National Park landscape. They run parallel along major wadis (valleys) and  bisect the Wuthaylan National Park into half with almost equal portions within the governorates of Al Dilam and Al Muhazimiyah.</p>
      <p> Some of the bedrock material within the  National Park are formed from by transformations of mud, coral and other skeleton fossils  that were accumulated on the ocean floor. The plateaus sections within the are composed of a mosaic of rocks, sand dunes  and loose gravels.  The crystalline rocks are a reservoir for oil. In fact, as you traverse Witheylan National Park you will find routes to oil and gas exploratory fields. </p>

    title: Vegetation Diversity in Wuthaylan National Park
    description: >
      <p> The different habitats within the Withaylan National Park have slight variations in the ecological conditions, soil moisture content and soil type. These variations promote botanical diversity within the National Park, as different plant species are adapted to different sub-habitats. </p>
      <p> The wadis form a network of attractive  reasonably well  vegetated community of ground flora stands inhabiting the main wadi channels. This is expected since the wadi channels function as sponges that trap surface water during rainy seasons and slowly release it to trees, shrubs and other herbaceous vegetations along the channels. They form ecologically diverse and productive edge habitats with higher soil moisture contents. Acacia tortilis, Lycium shawii and Heliotropium crispum are most dominant vegetation community in Witheylan National Park.  Acacia tortilis is determined as the key stone vegetation species in the National Park. </p>

      <p> The plateau sections have relatively low vegetation cover with higher amounts of bare soils (mainly clay-loamy soils) and stony limestones slab surfaces. Although they are the most ecologically disturbed habitats within the national park, they are characterized by high flora diversity than at  the wadi channels. This could be due to the varied micro-climates and heterogeneity of the soil substrates at the plateau summits to support botanically diverse flora. Rhanterium epaposum and Stipagrostis obtusa are the dominant plant community that colonize the plateau sections of Wuthaylan National Park. </p>
      <p> The hygrophilous vegetation  community occur in very restricted spaces in the Witheylan National Park landscape. They colonize ecological niches such as those in permanent water source areas  of Ain Masla and Kidera springs. </p>
      <p> Overall, about 48 plant species were recorded with varied vegetation types: 6 trees, 10 shrubs and  32 herbaceous plant communities. They belong to 22 different botanical families.  </p>

    title: Vegetation Diversity in Wuthaylan National Park
    description: >
      <p> Faunal species within Witheylan National Park and adjacent areas exist in reasonably low numbers within the National Park. The  wadis channels  and plateau escarpments provide habitats that shelter several mammals, birds, reptiles and even invertebrates. Some of the easily noticeable mammals include:</p>
      <li> 1. Arabian sand gazelle (Gazella marica) confirmed through individual sightings, fecal droppings and/or  data retrieved from the camera traps. These gazelles were re-introduced into Witheylan National Park after being held in captive breeding  enclosures at the wadi Jalabi that  branches off the main wadi and released to the wild in 2022. Their population seems to be declining due to hunting, predation by carnivores and habitat degradation.</li>
      <li> 2. Arabian red fox (Vulpes vulpes arabica) that is mostly active at night.  It is brownish pale in color and  native to Arabian peninsula. Its adaptations  to the desert conditions include smaller body, larger ears and fur between toes to wade off heat from the feet. </li>
      <li> 3. Arabian wolf (Canis lupus arabs) that is an extremely rare species facing extinction. It is also native to the Arabian peninsula, adapted to the desert conditions and living in small pockets in the escarpments of Najd plateau. Tracks of the Arabian fox were noticed in the National Park.</li>
      <li> 4. Ratel or Honey badger (Mellivora capensis) that mostly leads solitary existence. It is an extremely rare sighting animal with striking patterns of black lower body and white upper body fur extending to the tail.  It is a successful hunter, scavenger and forager. It mainly feeds on young mammals, rodents of all sizes, birds, reptiles, insects etc.</li>
